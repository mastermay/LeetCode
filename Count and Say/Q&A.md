[Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
`1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...`

1. `1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
2. `11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
3. `21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n, generate the n<sup>th</sup> sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
